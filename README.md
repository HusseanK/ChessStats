Creating a basic analysis using Chess.com's data.

Main libraries/dependencies:
    - Matplotlib
    - Requests

Bundled in UV. 

The aim of this project was to get further experience with HTTP Requests, and gain experience in matplotlib

The overall goal is to be able to plot all the games i've played against a friend.

However this would work with any user, and data, with small changes.
